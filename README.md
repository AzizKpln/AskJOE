# AskJOE

## What is AskJOE?
AskJoe is a tool that utilizes [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to assist researchers wanting to use [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) as their malware analysis tool. It was based on the [Gepetto](https://github.com/JusticeRage/Gepetto) idea.
With its capabilities, OpenAI highly simplifies the practice of reverse engineering, allowing researchers to better detect and mitigate threats.
